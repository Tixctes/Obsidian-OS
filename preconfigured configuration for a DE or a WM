KDE Plasma

    Extremely customizable DE.

    Can be minimal or full-featured depending on how you set it up.

    Tons of configuration options for almost every UI element.

    Supports scripts, widgets, and layouts.

XFCE

    Lightweight but configurable.

    Simple configuration with plenty of tweak options.

    Great if you want a classic desktop thatâ€™s easy to personalize.

GNOME (with extensions)

    By default less configurable, but with extensions, it can become quite powerful.

    Extensions can add custom layouts, applets, and tweaks.

i3 / Sway (Wayland)

    i3 is a tiling WM that's very minimal but highly scriptable.

    Sway is a Wayland-compatible i3 replacement.

    Config via plain text files, with lots of community scripts.

    Great for keyboard-driven workflows and precise control.

bspwm

    Binary Space Partitioning WM.

    Manages windows as binary trees.

    Configuration done via shell scripts, very flexible.

    Works well with sxhkd for hotkeys.

awesomeWM

    Lua-configured dynamic WM.

    Highly programmable and extensible with Lua scripting.

    Can be turned into anything from tiling to floating setups.

    Great if you want to write custom logic.

xmonad

    Written and configured in Haskell.

    Very stable and minimal.

    Highly configurable, but requires some Haskell knowledge.

    Perfect if you want a pure functional programming approach to WM config.

herbstluftwm

    Manual tiling WM with a focus on simplicity and scriptability.

This summmary is ai-generated by ChatGPT.
